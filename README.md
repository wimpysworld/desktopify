# This project is discontinued ‚ò†Ô∏è

**This project initially served as a PoC for bringing [Ubuntu Desktop to Raspberry Pi](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2020/10/ubuntu-20-10-raspberry-pi-4-desktop) when I worked at [Canonical](https://canonical.com/). Now that [Raspberry Pi is a release target for Ubuntu Desktop](https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi), this project has no purpose.**

## Introduction

Desktopify is a simple script to convert
[Ubuntu Server for the Raspberry Pi](https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi)
to one of the official Ubuntu desktop flavours.

We have a Discord for this project: [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/712850672223125565?color=0C306A&label=WimpysWorld%20Discord&logo=Discord&logoColor=ffffff&style=flat-square)](https://discord.gg/hy7uZfX)

[![Raspberry Pi 4 8GB - Install Ubuntu Desktop 20.04 LTS](https://img.youtube.com/vi/umtZuUJOU38/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umtZuUJOU38)
## Requirements    
  * SD Card (preferred 32 GB or more) & MicroSD to SD Adaptor (to connect sd card to your laptop/PC).
  * Raspberry PI 4 model B (preferred with 8GB ram).
  * Monitor, Keyboard and necessary cables to connect them to RaspberryPi.
  * Mobile data (approx 2GB) for downloading dependencies.
  

## Setup

  * Download [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) software to choose your respective OS compatible with raspberryPi.
  * Connect the SD card to your laptop/PC and then open RPI Imager software, you will see screen like below    
    
![RPI IMAGER ACREEN](.github/rpi_screen.png)    
  * Select `CHOOSE OS` --> `Other Support OS` --> `UBUNTU`.    
  * Choose any server image file. For this i'm using `ubuntu 20.04.05 64 bit server image file`.    
  * Click `CHOOSE STORAGE` and then select your SD card.
  * finally click on `WRITE` and wait for some time.
  * After completion, insert sd card to your RaspberryPi and connect keyboard & Monitor to it. You can power RaspberryPI from your laptop in case your don't have powerbank.    
  * power on t your PI and wait for 1-2 minutes.
  * Lgin to ubuntu OS. By default the username and password are both `ubuntu`.    
  * Change your password and then login again.
  * Yo need to connect to a wifi to download necessary packages. Best way is to connect to your MObile hotspot.
  * Now you need to know your wifi card name. For that type following command on the ubuntu server    

  ``` 
  ls /sys/class/net
  ```  
  On my system, the output is like this and my wifi card name is `wlan0`.    

  For further steps, i'll be assuming the same for you.    
  * Assuming that your Mobile network wifi name/SSID is `MyWifi` and password is `MyPass`.   
  * type the following command to edit your network configuration    
  ``` 
  sudo nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
  ```
  by default you will see the following data in this file    

  ![default network configuration](.github/default_net_config.png)    
  * Edit this file as follows  
    
  ![new network configuration](.github/final_net_config.png)    

  * After writing the above data, type `ctrl + O` to write, then `Enter` to save and then `ctrl + X` to exit from the file.    
  * type `sudo reboot` and then login again. Check if your are connect to your mobile wifi using the command    
  ```
  hostname -I
  ```  
  If you see some IP address as output, means you'r done.    
  
  <!-- * Boot the Ubuntu Server SDHC on a Raspberry Pi 2, 3 or 4.
  * Login to the Raspberry Pi; username `ubuntu` and password `ubuntu`
      * You will be prompted to change the password
  * Clone the project
    * `git clone https://github.com/wimpysworld/desktopify.git`
  * Change your current directory to desktopify directory
    * `cd desktopify`
  * Convert the server to a desktop
    * `sudo ./desktopify --de ubuntu-mate` -->

## Installation    
  1. clone this repo by typing following command on ubuntu server

  2. go to the repo folder and download the desktop image using following commands    

  ```
